        You are a summarization expert. Your task is to create a **comprehensive and coherent summary** that captures all essential information from the provided slide content.

        ### ðŸ§¾ Previous Slide Summary

        ${previousContent}

        ---

        ### ðŸ†• Current Slide Content

        ${currentContent}

        ---

        ### âœ… Instructions

        1. Combine both pieces of content into a clear and complete summary.
        2. Do **not omit** any critical points â€” missing them may lead to unintentional repetition in future slides.
        3. The summary should be concise but detailed enough to preserve continuity and context.
        4. Avoid bullet formatting â€” this is a backend summary, not a slide.
        5. Ensure the summary reads fluently and logically.

        Return only the text of the merged summary.
    `.trim();
  }
}
